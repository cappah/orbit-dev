# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the spirit of maintaining an inclusive and supportive atmosphere,
we as participants and maintainers promise to make participating in our project and culture a harassment-free experience for all,
regardless of age, gender and level of experience,

## Our Expectations

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and supportive words 
* Being mindful of all points of view and perspectives 
* Taking critical feedback gracefully 
* Focusing on what is right for the group 
* Demonstrating concern for other community members

Participants' inappropriate conduct includes the following examples:

* The use of sexualized words or imagery, as well as unwanted sexual attention or advances 
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory tweets, and personal or political attacks 
* Public or private abuse 
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without express permission

## Our Roles and Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the expectations of reasonable behaviour and are required
to respond to any cases of inappropriate conduct with effective and equal disciplinary action.

Project maintainers have the authority and duty to delete, modify, or reject remarks, commits, code, wiki edits,
problems, and other submissions that are not in accordance with this Code of Conduct,
as well as to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other improper, 
threatening, insulting, or dangerous actions.
